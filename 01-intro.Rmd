# Introduction {#intro}

This data analysis project was conducted with the advisement of Dr. Gregory Macfarlane, during a research project as well as a University Class Assignment. This project involves collecting and analyzing data from different sources and compiling this data into a readable and reproduceable fashion. There is not any recommendations for changes to make after this data because it is a simple analysis. However, there is the recommendation for future research using this data and analysis for a connection to other branches along the same research path. 

This research involves collecting data about grocery stores and compiling it according to block groups and which block groups are within an accessible regions of these grocery stores. The future application would be to analyze this data in regards to emotional and mental health and use other resources as well, including parks and libraries rather than just grocery stores.

This report includes a literature review, outlining previous research accomplished as well as research on the connection to emotional health as well as accessibility. We also include our methodology, options for future application, and resources.
